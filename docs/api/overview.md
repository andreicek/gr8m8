# Overview

The linkhut API is a way to interact programatically with your bookmarks, notes and other linkhut data.

Wherever possible the linkhut API uses the same syntax and method names as the [Pinboard API](https://www.pinboard.in/api/).

All API methods are GET requests, even when good REST habits suggest they should use a different verb.

Methods return data in XML format.
